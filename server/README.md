## Features

Template Engine: EJS
Nodemon for hot-reloading

## How to use

Copy this folder and navigate to it in the terminal
run `npm install`
run `DEBUG=011-hot-reload:* npm run devstart`
open `http://localhost:3000/` in the browser

### Reloading

After making changes to a file, you don't need to restart the whole application. Nodemon does *some magic* that allows you to simply refresh the browser.
